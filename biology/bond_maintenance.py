    Where "toward open space" means: away from the centroid of all the bonded neighbors. This should prevent the
    situation where particles look for potential bonding partners but can't find one in the direction in which
    they are most needed (the direction of an incipient hole, i.e., toward areas where particles are most
    stretched apart).
    
    This applies only to internal particles. Furthermore, for particles bonded directly to the leading edge, a
    modified version of this is applied, to prevent anomalies near the edge. (The empty area below the leading edge
    would be seen as a "hole", and edge-bonded internal particles would get ejected into it.) For those edge-bonded
    particles, whenever the centroid-based force vector would push the particle closer to the leading edge,
    remove the edge-directed (vegetalward) component of the vector, leaving only the horizontal (circumferential)
    component, and use that.
